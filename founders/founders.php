    <div class="founder-description">
        <p>“ In the world around us, be it Japan, Malaysia, Korea or India, one of the key truths
            is the obsession of parents with the education of their children. This is the common
            trait found across the world and no effort is too high to ensure the best! Investment
            of time and money by the parents in education was, and will remain the top most
            priority, however knowing where to enroll and how to choose from a myriad of
            courses and activities to help their child learn better remains the toughest task. Toys
            N Joy Playschool uses playway method to educate and prepare kids to brace the ever
            competitive Educational system and champion the development requirements. We
            believe that one of the most persistent myths about success is the idea that some
            people are born with the capabilities to attain it and others aren’t. We are born with
            same sets of muscles and with proper grooming of those muscles- each one has the
            potential to unlock the gates of success.” <br>- Mona Asthana</p>
