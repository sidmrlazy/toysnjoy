    <p>Traditional Tuition centers and teachers have become like a second school for kids
        and no longer ignite curiosity and excitement in them. They are a routine that
        children run away from and is an added burden to their school routine.</p>

    <p>We at TNJ understand this predicament and have created a beautiful, fun,
        interactive Learning Zone for students of classes 1st to 6th. The TNJ Homework
        Assistance & Tuition Center is solely dedicated to help children complete their
        daily homeworks, clear the concepts that are taught in their schools and prepare
        for tests & exams for all subjects.</p>
    <p>The center is divided in two rooms, one for homework and concept room ( students
        sit in a group of 10, class wise and a teacher helps and guides them through their
        dayâ€™s assignment and school lessons)- the other room is more of an individualistic
        setting, where students to have learn, memorize for tests and exams sit separately
        and are monitored by a teacher.</p>
