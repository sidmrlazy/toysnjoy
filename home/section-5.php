    <p class="first-para">Poetically speaking, Preschool teaching is no less than an art form. Imagine yourself
        guiding a bunch of young children who are venturing out of their comfort zone for
        the first time, and teaching them the basic skills of life. Not every child is similar,
        not every child requires the same amount of care; to be able to fulfill the needs of a
        child, and to enable them to start becoming independent in their actions is what
        preschool teaching is all about.</p>

    <p class="second-para">It is not just a learning experience for children, but also for parents who begin to
        grow with their child. Thus, a preschool teacher is no less than an artist
        commanding a bunch of young ones.</p>

    <p class="third-para">But why are we talking about this? A very simple answer for this is our ignorance
        towards the importance of preschool education. In a country where pre-schooling
        has only recently become popular & termed important for many obvious reasons,
        there still exists uncertainty & lack of surety as to how a preschool functions &
        what it aims to achieve.</p>

    <p class="fourth-para">Like any other educational institute, teachers are the backbone of the entire
        preschool system. These teachers, young and experienced, are entitled with the
        task of educating children in their eating habits, reading skills, toilet habits, and
        developing their cognitive skills. While this aspect of preschool teaching is clear to
        the parents at large, what is less understood on their part is how all this is done.</p>

    <p class="fifth-para">Here, we are sharing the Grade-wise Teaching methodology that we have adopted
        at the Toys n Joy Playschool so that Parents are well versed with what to expect
        from us and how to evaluate their child’s growth and skill development. This will
        also help Parents better understand and choose the right courses for their children.</p>

                <p class="method-label">Playschool, Pre Nursery, Nursery, Kindergarten, SRP</p>
                <p class="method-description">A very widely accepted and popular method of Play school teaching is the
                    play
                    way
                    method. We at Toys n Joy essentially believe and abide by this school of thought
                    that says that the best way of teaching a child is through taking up activities. We
                    have incorporated activities such as role plays, virtual games, singing, free play and
                    a lot more, to teach children. We believe that such a method of learning brings
                    exposure to the child in a friendly environment with no pressure at all. The focus is
                    entirely on the needs of the child and the activities revolve around fulfilling such
                    needs.</p>

                <p class="method-description">The play way method fits well with the commitment and aim of not burdening
                    the
                    kids with tasks they are not yet capable of performing.</p>

                <p class="method-description">Active learning is the basis of HighScope teaching Methodology. By playing
                    and
                    their communications with others in the classroom, children will learn through
                    their surroundings. They’ll work on academic skills while enhancing their emotional
                    and social development.</p>
                <p class="method-description">Teachers don’t take control – they are seen more as partners. They’ll hand
                    out
                    encouragement and be there to support kids as they work on problem solving.</p>

                <p class="method-label">Playgroup, Pre- Nursery, SRP</p>
                <p class="method-description">Some people think it’s easier to learn languages when you are younger.
                    Knowing
                    a
                    second language can give a child career advancement down the road or it can
                    preserve your family’s cultural background and ties.</p>
                <p class="method-description">To help with this goal, We have incorporated language immersion techniques
                    for
                    our preschool toddlers. This technique helps introduce children to languages that
                    aren’t spoken at home.</p>
                <p class="method-description">If you think children are spending too much of their time inside and you
                    fondly look
                    back at your childhood days of exploring the great outdoors all day, our unique
                    outdoor preschool technique might interest you. We have dedicated hours and
                    days for our dayboarders and SRP students for playing outside on swings, outdoor
                    games, visiting parks and other kid- friendly places. Through this we are able to
                    make kids familiar with nature, outdoors, more energetic and observant.</p>

                <p class="method-heading">Reggio Emilia Method</p>
                <p class="method-label">Kindergarten, SRP, HATC</p>
                <p class="method-description">Another school of thought or method of teaching adopted at Toys n Joy
                    Playschool
                    is the Reggio Emilia Method. Evolved in Italy, inherently, this approach believes in
                    teaching through activities. What makes this approach different and vital to Toys n
                    Joy Playschool’s teaching methodology is how we inculcate different types of
                    activities and the core values it promotes. The approach believes in & is aimed at
                    enabling the child to make their own place in society. It encourages communication
                    with others, forming relationships, and promotes the child to wonder. The NJ class
                    room acts merely as a catalyst that consists of material facilitating learning. The
                    children are encouraged to communicate through music, art, dance, writing, and
                    more.</p>
                <p class="method-description">Self-directed learning is the hallmark of this method. Its philosophy is
                    that
                    a child’s
                    personality takes root during their younger years while they are developing, and
                    that they have many ways of expressing themselves and their ideas.</p>
                <p class="method-description">Since allowing children to express themselves is a key component of this
                    method,
                    children at Toys n Joy are given a say in the scope of their learning. They are
                    allowed to move around, observe, touch things, and explore their relationships with
                    other kids in the classroom.</p>

                <p class="method-heading">Bank Street Approach</p>
                <p class="method-label">Playschool, Pre Nursery. Nursery, Kindergarten, SRP, HATC</p>
                <p class="method-description">The goal with this approach to teaching is encouraging children to become
                    lifelong
                    learners. By getting children interested in their surroundings, such as the objects
                    around them, places they see and the people they interact with, it will spark a love
                    of learning. Rather than just memorizing facts, children at Toys n Joy Playschool are
                    given other ways to learn, such as puzzles, field trips, and blocks.</p>
                <p class="method-description">The atmosphere of Toys n Joy Playschool classrooms isn’t competitive –
                    teachers
                    encourage children to learn at their own pace and through interaction with their
                    peers. Playing is one of the keys elements teachers use for learning.</p>
                <p class="method-description">Teachers try to touch on a subject through many disciplines. When children
                    are
                    playing with a toy kitchen set, teachers might be asking questions about food,
                    stores, health, and could plan a field trip based on that play experience.</p>
