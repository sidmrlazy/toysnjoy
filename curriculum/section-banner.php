    <h1>NEIGHBOURHOOD PLAYSCHOOL</h1>
    <p>Toys n Joy is based on a unique concept of "Neighbourhood" play school, developed
        with the specific purpose of providing International Quality Education for the
        youngest group of students. We aim to provide your child with a happy and healthy
        environment of "Learning through Participation", which enhances physical,
        intellectual, emotional, aesthetic & social development of a child by strengthening
        their perceptual and cognitive abilities.</p>
    <p>It is only through curiosity that children learn to understand, accept, admire and
        lead the world around them. It provides them with a strong and fine foundation for
        overall personality development. Toys N Joy is close to your child's heart and close
        to your home as well. Each child is individually guided to learn, read, write,
        recognize various Alphabets, Numbers, Shapes, Colors, Objects in a playful
        atmosphere and to verbalize their thoughts through simple sentence formations.</p>
    <p>The kids at Toys N Joy are made to learn through trial and error, active
        participation, observation, experimentation, interaction, demonstration in a happy,
        healthy and homely atmosphere. We help highlight and groom each child's ‘Natural
        Traits and Talents’ to enable them to shine brighter by encouraging them to
        achieve success, admiration, applause and adulation as they move ahead in life.
        Hence, guiding them to grow up to True enlightenment and become life-long
        learners.</p>
